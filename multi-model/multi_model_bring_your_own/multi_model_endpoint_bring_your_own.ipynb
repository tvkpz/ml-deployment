    "# Amazon SageMaker Multi-Model Endpoints using your own algorithm container\n",
    "With [Amazon SageMaker multi-model endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/multi-model-endpoints.html), customers can create an endpoint that seamlessly hosts up to thousands of models. These endpoints are well suited to use cases where any one of a large number of models, which can be served from a common inference container, needs to be invokable on-demand and where it is acceptable for infrequently invoked models to incur some additional latency. For applications which require consistently low inference latency, a traditional endpoint is still the best choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, Amazon SageMaker manages the loading and unloading of models for a multi-model endpoint, as they are needed. When an invocation request is made for a particular model, Amazon SageMaker routes the request to an instance assigned to that model, downloads the model artifacts from S3 onto that instance, and initiates loading of the model into the memory of the container. As soon as the loading is complete, Amazon SageMaker performs the requested invocation and returns the result. If the model is already loaded in memory on the selected instance, the downloading and loading steps are skipped and the invocation is performed immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the inference container to serve multiple models in a multi-model endpoint, it must implement [additional APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/build-multi-model-build-container.html) in order to load, list, get, unload and invoke specific models. This notebook demonstrates how to build your own inference container that implements these APIs.\n",

    "To update a model, you would follow the same approach as above and add it as a new model. For example, if you have retrained the `resnet_18.tar.gz` model and wanted to start invoking it, you would upload the updated model artifacts behind the S3 prefix with a new name such as `resnet_18_v2.tar.gz`, and then change the `TargetModel` field to invoke `resnet_18_v2.tar.gz` instead of `resnet_18.tar.gz`. You do not want to overwrite the model artifacts in Amazon S3, because the old version of the model might still be loaded in the containers or on the storage volume of the instances on the endpoint. Invocations to the new model could then invoke the old version of the model."
